'!DOCTYPE html': This declaration specifies that the document is an HTML5 document.



'html lang="en"': The opening tag for the HTML document. The lang="en" attribute indicates that the document's primary language is English.



'head': This section contains metadata about the document, such as character encoding, the viewport configuration, and the document title.



'meta charset="utf-8"': Sets the character encoding of the document to UTF-8, which supports a wide range of characters.


'meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"': Defines the viewport settings for responsive web design. It ensures that the page adapts to the device's width and sets the initial zoom level to 1.0.


'title'Photo Gallery'/title': Sets the title of the web page, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.


'link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css"': This tag links an external CSS stylesheet to the HTML document. The href attribute specifies the path to the stylesheet, which is named "styles.css." This stylesheet is used to define the page's styles and layout.


'body': The main content of the web page is contained within this tag.



'header class="header"': This is a header section that typically contains introductory content or navigation elements.



'h1'css flexbox photo gallery'/h1': An <h1> (header 1) tag is used to define the main heading of the page. In this case, it is "css flexbox photo gallery."


'div class="gallery"': This <div> element with the class "gallery" is used to create a container for a photo gallery.



'img src="URL" alt="imageX"': A series of <img> (image) tags are used to display images in the gallery. Each <img> tag has a src attribute that specifies the image's source URL, and an alt attribute that provides alternative text for accessibility.


Here's a breakdown of the image tags:



'img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-photo-gallery/1.jpg" alt="image1"': Displays the first image with an alternative text of "image1."


'img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-photo-gallery/2.jpg" alt="image2"': Displays the second image with an alternative text of "image2."
